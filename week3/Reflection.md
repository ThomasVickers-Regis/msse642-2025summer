## Week 3 Reflection

This week focused on secure development practices and documentation, with a particular emphasis on creating comprehensive and secure project documentation. The week's activities provided valuable insights into maintaining security through proper documentation and development workflows.

Key learnings from this week include:
- Understanding the importance of secure documentation practices
- Learning how to write comprehensive README files that include security considerations
- Exploring Visual Studio Code extensions for security development
- Understanding the role of documentation in maintaining secure codebases
- Practical experience with setting up secure development environments in VS Code

The focus on documentation and development tools this week highlighted how proper documentation is not just about code clarity but also about maintaining security. The exercises with VS Code extensions demonstrated how modern development tools can enhance security practices.

This week's emphasis on documentation and development tools has shown me how security is integrated into every aspect of software development, from the tools we use to how we document our work.
