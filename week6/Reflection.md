## Week 6 Reflection

This week provided valuable hands-on experience with penetration testing tools and techniques, deepening my understanding of both offensive and defensive security practices. Through the assignments, I learned how to set up and run Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Metasploitable2 in a virtualized environment, and how these tools can be used together to simulate real-world attack scenarios.

One of the key skills I developed was using Vagrant to quickly launch and access my Kali Linux environment. This streamlined the process of getting my testing environment up and running, allowing me to focus on the actual penetration testing tasks. I also practiced verifying network connectivity between Kali Linux and Metasploitable2, which is a crucial step before beginning any security assessment.

Using Metasploit, I explored how to search for and configure port scanning modules. Running a port scan against the Metasploitable2 VM helped me understand how attackers identify open ports and services as potential entry points. This exercise reinforced the importance of regularly scanning and monitoring systems for exposed services, as well as restricting unnecessary ports to reduce the attack surface.

Beyond the technical skills, this week's assignments highlighted the importance of securing applications and infrastructure to prevent attacks. By seeing firsthand how easily open ports and misconfigurations can be discovered, I gained a greater appreciation for best practices such as using firewalls, keeping software up to date, and validating the integrity of software and data. The Security Risk Analysis assignment further emphasized the need for strong controls in the software supply chain, including digital signatures, secure CI/CD pipelines, and vigilant monitoring.

Overall, this week strengthened my ability to use industry-standard tools for both attacking and defending systems. It also deepened my understanding of why proactive security measures are essential to protect applications and data from real-world threats.
