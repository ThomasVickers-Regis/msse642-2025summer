## Week 2 Reflection

I had a few issues during setup because I used virtualbox perviously. I had to setup a new ethernet adaptor before it would allow my kali linux to connect. I also had to use my powershell since it is setup more for environment instead of the GitBash. I actually already had Git Bash installed when I had windows 10, however I find windows 11 works a lot better with powershell than Git Bash. I used it for most of the assignment since it was easier to navigate. I also had issues setting up metasploitable since the website wouldn't allow me to download the imagine. I got it from source forge and also had to select the small icon next to the hard disk SATA Port 0 option to create a new virtual hard drive before I could get the application to pull the correct OS.
