## Week 2 Reflection

This week was particularly engaging as we delved into practical security tools and version control systems. The hands-on experience with Vagrant and Git provided valuable insights into secure development practices and infrastructure management.

Key learnings from this week include:
- Deep dive into Git as a distributed version control system, understanding its architecture and workflow
- Practical experience with Vagrant for creating and managing virtual development environments
- Understanding the importance of secure development environments
- Hands-on experience with setting up and configuring virtual machines for security testing
- Learning about different types of version control systems and their security implications

The practical exercises with Vagrant and Git were particularly valuable, as they demonstrated how to set up secure development environments and manage code securely. The screenshots and documentation of the setup process will serve as valuable references for future projects.

This week's focus on practical tools and secure development practices has given me a better understanding of how to implement security measures from the ground up in software development projects.
