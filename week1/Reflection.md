## Week 1 Reflection

This week marked the beginning of our journey into software security engineering. We were introduced to the fundamental concepts and importance of security in software development. The week focused on establishing a strong foundation for understanding security principles and practices that we'll build upon throughout the course.

Key takeaways from this week include:
- Understanding the critical role of security in modern software development
- Introduction to basic security concepts and terminology
- Setting up our development environment and tools
- Establishing good security practices from the start of development

This week served as an excellent foundation for the more hands-on security work we'll be doing in the coming weeks. I'm looking forward to applying these fundamental concepts to real-world security scenarios.
