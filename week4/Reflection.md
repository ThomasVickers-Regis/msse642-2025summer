## Week 4 Reflection

This week continued our exploration of security practices with a focus on risk analysis and security assessment. The week's activities provided deeper insights into identifying and mitigating security risks in software development.

Key learnings from this week include:
- Understanding the importance of security risk analysis in software development
- Learning how to identify and assess potential security vulnerabilities
- Developing skills in creating comprehensive security risk assessments
- Understanding how to prioritize security risks based on their impact and likelihood
- Learning how to document and communicate security risks effectively

The focus on security risk analysis this week has helped me understand how to systematically approach security in software development. The exercises in risk assessment have provided practical experience in identifying and evaluating security concerns.

This week's emphasis on risk analysis has shown me how to take a more structured approach to security, moving beyond just identifying vulnerabilities to understanding their potential impact and how to effectively address them.
