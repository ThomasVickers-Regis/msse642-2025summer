## Week 4 Reflection

This week's focus on threat modeling and security assessment provided valuable insights into identifying and mitigating security risks in software development. The hands-on experience with STRIDE and OWASP methodologies has significantly enhanced my understanding of application security. Developing the threat model for the hiking club application was particularly enlightening, as it helped me understand how to systematically identify potential security vulnerabilities in a real-world scenario. Through the STRIDE methodology, I learned to identify various security threats such as spoofing in user authentication and information disclosure in medical data storage. The OWASP threat modeling process taught me how to identify critical assets, map attack surfaces, assess vulnerabilities, and implement appropriate security controls. This practical experience has given me a framework for approaching security in future projects, moving beyond just identifying individual vulnerabilities to understanding how to analyze entire system architectures, evaluate security controls, and make informed decisions about security implementations. I now feel more confident in my ability to identify potential security issues early in the development process and implement appropriate safeguards.
