## Week 7 Reflection

### Key Takeaways on AI Coding Tools

This week's discussion about AI coding tools like Replit and Cursor revealed some important insights about the future of software engineering.

**The Good**: AI tools can significantly speed up development by generating functional code quickly. They're particularly useful for experienced developers who can leverage them as productivity multipliers.

**The Critical Gap**: These tools only produce what you explicitly ask for and lack inherent understanding of security best practices. They won't automatically implement security measures like input validation, proper session management, or protection against OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities unless specifically requested.

**The Risk**: Inexperienced developers using AI tools without strong security knowledge could create functional but vulnerable applications. The tools don't replace the need for understanding secure coding principles.

**The Lesson**: Software engineering expertise is more important than ever. While AI handles the mechanical aspects of coding, human engineers need to:
- Know what security measures to request
- Understand architectural principles
- Be able to critically review and test generated code
- Have the knowledge to verify security implementations

**Moving Forward**: I need to focus on building strong foundations in security fundamentals, testing methodologies, and architectural patterns. AI tools are powerful assistants, but they require knowledgeable human guidance to produce secure, well-designed systems.

The future isn't about competing with AIâ€”it's about learning to work with it while maintaining the expertise that ensures our systems are secure and reliable.
